# An overview of time-to-event analysis for dental researchers

This tutorial is meant to serve as a reference for dental researchers interested in learning about time-to-event analysis (*a.k.a* survival analysis). 

The dental data in this tutorial describe a set of patients treated with crown margin repairs at the [University of Iowa College of Dentistry and Dental Clinics](https://dentistry.uiowa.edu/). For more information on this data set, refer to the [open access JADA article](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000281772100547X?casa_token=ijNcJA1nrPkAAAAA:AKmKgkmqnJEx6kFP_IzLHmO9BRTe7TtaNPrCFPh3ficihEGcu4GttwfisXaJr0d9SKf8z2OpZA)

For those interested in further exploring time-to-event analysis using the `R` programming language, I have found [Emily Zaboor's tutorial](https://www.emilyzabor.com/tutorials/survival_analysis_in_r_tutorial.html) to be a helpful resource.
